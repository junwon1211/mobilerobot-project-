# mobilerobot-project

Mobilerobot project in mechanical engineering Department, Osaka University.
Here are three problems of this projects.
There no description of problems, but you can check in mechanical engineering Department class.

1st problem: Chicken race.
Our team use pid controller for stop in front of wall imeddiately by using sonar sensor.

2nd problem: Cow race.
Our team use two infraded recievers for taking black or white line. In first time we use expected value method for using PID controller(certificating location), However, there are limiation for adapting expected value method in using only 2 Infraded sensor. So we just use simple argorithm, for example, "turn right()", "turn left()", "go straght()"

3rd problem: mobilerobot football.
we use 2dof mapulator, and simple mobile robot controlling by infraed remote controller.
